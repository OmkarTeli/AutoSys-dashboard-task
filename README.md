# AutoSys-dashboard-task
# Overview
### The Product Gallery Dashboard is a web application built using React.js, designed to provide users with insightful visualizations and key metrics related to sales and revenue. Leveraging the power of ECharts for charting capabilities, the dashboard offers an intuitive interface for monitoring and analyzing product performance.

# Key Features
## Interactive Charts
### he dashboard includes at least two interactive charts powered by ECharts, offering dynamic visual representations of sales data. Examples include line charts for tracking total sales over time and bar charts for comparing sales across different product categories.

## Custom Components
### A custom component has been developed to seamlessly integrate and display these charts within the dashboard interface. This component ensures a cohesive and visually appealing presentation of data, enhancing the user experience.

## Widgets (MUI/ custom made)
Widgets are strategically placed within the dashboard to highlight essential metrics such as total sales and revenue. These widgets provide at-a-glance insights into the overall performance of the product gallery, enabling users to quickly assess critical information.

# Installation of required librari

# Technical Details
## Framework
### React.js is utilized as the primary framework for building the dashboard application, offering a component-based architecture for modular development and enhanced maintainability.

## Charting Library
### ECharts, a powerful open-source charting library, is integrated into the project to create visually compelling and interactive charts. Its extensive features and customization options enable the creation of dynamic data visualizations tailored to specific business needs.

# UI Libraries
## Material-UI
### The dashboard interface is partially designed using Material-UI components, providing a set of pre-designed React components that follow Google's Material Design guidelines. Material-UI offers a wide range of customizable components, ensuring a sleek and modern look for the dashboard.

## Tailwind CSS
### Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first CSS styling, enabling rapid prototyping and efficient styling of components. With its utility classes approach, Tailwind CSS streamlines the development process by eliminating the need for writing custom CSS styles, resulting in a more maintainable codebase.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
